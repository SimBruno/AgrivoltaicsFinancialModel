# AgrivoltaicsFinancialModel
Agrivoltaics Financial Model

## Overview
This repository contains a financial modeling tool designed to evaluate the economic profitability of agrivoltaics projects from both the solar developer's and farmer's perspectives. The model integrates realistic farming practices and PV system characteristics to assess feasibility, profitability, and optimal design strategies.

## Key Features
✅ Dual-entity financial modeling – Separates financial inputs and outputs for farmers and developers.

✅ General model - Applicable across the U.S. (and out with minro adjustements)

✅ Partnerships - Different stakeholders’ partnership structures available to develop the projects

✅ Tax & financial handling – Accounts for tax credit carryover

✅ Scalable analysis – Supports PV systems ranging from 0.5 MW to 30 MW with various crop types and practices (specialty crops, field crops, crop rotation...).

✅ Crop yield modeling (upcoming) – Simulates agricultural productivity under solar panels based on microclimate and radiation.

✅ Enhanced energy modeling (upcoming) – Incorporates pvlib for improved PV system yield estimations.

## Installation


## Data Sources
📊 USDA Quick Stats for crop yield and pricing data

📊 NREL PV system benchmarks

📊 State-level incentive programs

## Future Enhancements
🚀 Implement crop yield modeling based on microclimate and radiation models

🚀 Improve energy modeling with pvlib for better yield estimation

🚀 Improve cash flow analysis by including other metrics such as Net Operating Losses, or Change in Working Capital, for the energy systems
