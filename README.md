# AgrivoltaicsFinancialModel
Agrivoltaics Financial Model

## Overview
This repository contains a financial modeling tool designed to evaluate the economic profitability of agrivoltaics projects from both the solar developer's and farmer's perspectives. The model integrates realistic farming practices and PV system characteristics to assess feasibility, profitability, and optimal design strategies.

## Files

1️⃣ financial_tool_final.ipynb - Main script to run the financial model with customizable parameters (only this file is needed to run the model).
2️⃣ tradprices_ipynb - Script to clean and process USDA crop price data.
3️⃣ tradyields_ipynb - Script to clean and process USDA crop yield data.
4️⃣ externaldataupload.ipynb - Script to create crop datasets.


## Key Features
✅ New agrivoltaic financial framework including solar PV and farming perspectives.

✅ Iterative structure designed to target profitable agrivoltaic systems.

✅ Realistic inclusion of agriculture practices, business partnerships, and tax handling.

✅ Tax & financial handling – Accounts for tax credit carryover

✅ Scalable analysis – Supports PV systems ranging from 0.5 MW to 30 MW with various crop types and practices (specialty crops, field crops, crop rotation...).

✅ Farm profits depend on land costs; developers benefit from economies of scale.

✅ Model addresses overestimation of profitability seen in previous methods.

## Data Sources
📊 USDA Quick Stats for crop yield and pricing data

📊 NREL PV system benchmarks

📊 State-level incentive programs

## Future Enhancements
🚀 Implement crop yield modeling based on microclimate and radiation models

🚀 Improve energy modeling with pvlib for better yield estimation

🚀 Improve cash flow analysis by including other metrics such as Net Operating Losses, or Change in Working Capital, for the energy systems
